Two-Dimensional Finite Difference Hartree-Fock program for diatomic molecules (version 3.0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

                                                                            
This program finds virtually exact solutions of the Hartree-Fock and density
functional theory equations for diatomic molecules and atoms. The quality of a
solution depends on grid size and arithmetic precision used. The lowest energy
eigenstates of a given irreducible representation and spin can be obtained. The DFT
support is facilitated via the libxc library (see `-l|L` options of the `./x2dhfctl`
script). The `lxcctl` script is provided to help test the support of the `x2dhf` program
for the libxc functionals.

The program can also used to obtain the ground and excited states of
one-electron systems with the (smoothed) Coulomb, Green-Sellin-Zachor,
or Kramers-Hennenberger potentials, as well the superposition of
atomic potentials.

Single particle two-dimensional numerical functions (orbitals) are
used to construct an anti-symmetric many-electron wave function of the
restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock model. The orbitals are obtained by
solving the Hartree-Fock equations in the form of the coupled
two-dimensional second-order (elliptic) partial differential equations
(PDE). The Coulomb and exchange potentials are obtained as solutions
of the corresponding Poisson equations. The PDEs are discretized by
the 8th-order central difference stencil on a two-dimensional grid,
while a Newton-Cotes quadrature rule is used to evalaute
integrals. The resulting large and sparse system of linear equations
is solved by the (multi-colour) successive overrelaxation method
((MC)SOR). The self-consistent-field iterations are interwoven with
the (MC)SOR ones and orbital energies and normalisation factors are
used to monitor the convergence. The accuracy of solutions depends
mainly on the grid-size and the system under consideration.

The programming language used is Fortran 90 and C (if the multi-threaded version
employing pthreads is requested). Therefore Fortran 90 and C compilers together with
CMake are needed to compile and build the program. This can be done by running
`./x2dhfctl -b`.  See `./x2dhfctl -h` and `INSTALL` for more details.

`./doc/users-guide.pdf` contains the description of the program's input data and its
usage.

`test-sets/` directory contains the dozens of specific examples and the testctl
script should be used to list and run them (try 'testctl -h').

`./lda_orbitals` and `./hf_orbitals` directories contain LDA and HF orbitals for a
number of atomic systems. These orbitals can be used to start the SCF process. The data
were generated by means of the HelFEM program and a finite-difference HF program for
atoms (qrhf), respectively,

`./bin` directory contains the x2dhf executable(s) and several BASH and
Perl scripts to facilitate the usage of the program (run `source .x2dhfrc`
to adjust the PATH variable accordingly). First of all try `xhf -h` and
`testctl -h`. See also `elpropctl -h`, `lxcctl -h` and `pecctl -h`.

To give the program a try, execute the following commands:
 source .x2dhfrc
 cd tests
 testctl run h/set-01
