To build the x2dhf program you need CMake version 3.14.0 or greater, and a
Fortran 90 compiler (a C compiler is needed when a multi-threaded version
is being built via pthreads).

The fresh installation is very simple: just run `./x2dhfctl -b` (see
`./x2dhfctl -h` for more options). This will compile and build the program
and install it in the ./bin directory.

By default x2dhf is compiled using gfortran with '-O3' optimization flag.
If you want to turn on all warnings, run `./x2dhf -b -a`.
